# Automated Focused Feedback Generation for Scientific Writing Assistance

In this work, we propose the task of focused feedback generation for scientific writing assistance. Focused feedback entails providing specific, actionable, and coherent comments that identify weaknesses in a paper or suggest revisions.

**Running SWIF<sup>2</sup>T**

1. Setup conda environment

```
conda create -n "focused_feedback_generation" python=3.12.1
conda activate focused_feedback_generation
```

2. Download the reranking model into the *plan_reranking_inference/* directory from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wRrown4YhKN3PiUdTm689sV-w9wiCdBC/view?usp=sharing
  
3. Update preferences for models and write API keys in config.py

4. Add the paper you would like to get reviewed in the root directory

5. Run the model

```
python run.py
```

**Future work**

Future work will focus on enhancing literature-augmented question answering, implementing a weakness detection model and using recent open-source LLMs to decrease the costs associated with running SWIF<sup>2</sup>T. If you are interested in collaborating, please do not hesitate to reach out.
